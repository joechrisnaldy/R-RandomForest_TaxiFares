# R-RandomForest_TaxiFares
## **Introduction** </br>
To drive a yellow New York taxi, you have to hold a "medallion" from the city's Taxi and Limousine Commission. Recently, one of those changed hands for over one million dollars, which shows how lucrative the job can be. But this is the age of business intelligence and analytics! Even taxi drivers can stand to benefit from some careful investigation of the data, guiding them to maximize their profits. We will also use regression trees and random forests to build a model to predict the locations and times when the biggest fares can be earned.

## **Conclusion** </br>
So it looks like the random forest model captured some of the patterns in our data. At this point in the analysis, we could do many more things that we haven't done. We could add more predictors if we have the data. We could try to fine-tune the parameters
of randomForest. And we should test the model on a hold-out test dataset. So from the map above, taxi drivers in NYC can expect to spend the most on a taxi ride in lower Manhattan.
